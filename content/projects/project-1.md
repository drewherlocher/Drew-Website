## Beware
**Lead Programmer & AI Programmer**  
*Unreal Engine | 3D Horror | Windows*

In a national park, rumors of a terrifying bear with supernatural powers are spreading like wildfire. Her name — Ursula. Only a conspiracy theorist like yourself would dare check it out...

As **Lead Programmer and AI Programmer**, I was responsible for the core systems that make Beware tick. My primary focus was designing and implementing Ursula's AI — building the behavior that lets her detect sound, react to the player's movements, and create the tension that drives the whole game.

### My Contributions

- Designed and programmed Ursula's AI behavior system, including sound detection and player awareness
- Led the programming team and coordinated technical implementation across the project

### Gameplay

- Roam a spooky forest full of set pieces and secrets
- Throw rocks to distract Ursula and use sound strategically
- Sneak, crouch, and stay out of sight to survive
- Capture the perfect photo of Ursula and escape — the better the photo, the better your ending

**Made with:** Unreal Engine  
**Genre:** 3D Horror, Stealth, Action  
**Team:**  Team AWESOME at Champlain College
